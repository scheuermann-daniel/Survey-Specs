# Survey Specs
## A custom surveying tool designed by Daniel Scheuermann. The website allows for the manager to post, edit, and view a variety of custom surveys and receive a computer-generated analysis of the data. The analysis includes charts, a report, etc.

## Languages: PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS

In the future, I plan to:
  - Post more surveys!
  - Edit manager page to make more user-friendly
  - Add other computer-generated analysis tools

The data attached is for the front-end, user only pages. Please feel free to look through the code!
